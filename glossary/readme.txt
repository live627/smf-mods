[b]Usage[/b]
This mod allows Glossary keywords to be displayed as tooltips (with their definition shown when hovering over/clicking on the keyword) in posts and other message types (ie, News items, PMs, and/or signatures).

[hr]
[b]Limitations when the use of the Glossary BBCode tag (ie, [nobbc][glossary]Keyword[/glossary][/nobbc]) is optional[/b]
1. Although the use of the Glossary BBCode tag is optional using the mod this way may result in a noticeable increase in the time it takes pages to load when a forum has a combination of a large glossary, a large number of verbose posts on displayed topic pages, and/or is hosted on a low spec server/shared hosting.  The reason for this is that using the mod this way results in the need to check [b]every[/b] word in [b]every[/b] post (and other messages types) on a displayed page for a possible Glossary keyword match and to create the tooltip if a keyword match is found.

2. If a Glossary keyword/synonym is not marked as case-sensitive and it matches a HTML tag or text in another BBCode tag (eg, [i]'BR'[/i] matches the [i]'<br>'[/i] tag, [i]'RED'[/i] matches the [i]'[nobbc][color=red][/nobbc]'[/i] tag) the matching string in the HTML tag/BBCode tag will be displayed as a Glossary keyword/tooltip.

3. The Glossary list is processed in alphanumeric order and, if a keyword has synonyms they are processed [b]before[/b] the next keyword, and as a result keywords/synonyms may not always have the expected definition shown in their tooltip.
[b]Scenario A.[/b] Keywords/synonyms that contain special characters and which are a substring of another keyword/synonym:
Keyword: [i]Ali'i[/i] with definition: [i]Chief or leader[/i]
Keyword: [i]Ali'i's Home[/i] with definition: [i]In the village ...[/i]
If the use of the Glossary BBCode tag is [b]optional[/b] the keyword [i]Ali'i's Home[/i] will [b]always[/b] have the definition of the keyword [i]Ali'i[/i] in a tooltip (ie, even if [i]Ali'i's Home[/i] is enclosed in the Glossary BBCode tag).

[b]Scenario B:[/b] Single/multi word keyword/synonym that is a substring of another single/multi word keyword/synonym: 
[b]First example:[/b] The keywords [i]'Submarine'[/i] and [i]'Yellow Submarine'[/i] have been added to the Glossary.
If the use of the Glossary BBCode tag is [b]optional[/b] the tooltip for the phrase [i]'Yellow Submarine'[/i] will [b]always[/b] contain the definition for the [i]'Submarine'[/i] keyword (ie, even if [i]'Yellow Submarine'[/i] is enclosed in the Glossary BBCode tag).
[b]Second example:[/b] The keywords [i]'Big Boat'[/i] (with a synonym of [i]'Yellow'[/i]), [i]'Submarine'[/i] and [i]'Yellow Submarine'[/i] have been added to the Glossary.
If the use of the Glossary BBCode tag is [b]optional[/b] the tooltip for the phrase [i]'Yellow Submarine'[/i] now will [b]always[/b] have [b]TWO[/b] tooltips: the definition for the [i]'Yellow'[/i] synonym of the [i]'Big Boat'[/i] keyword [b]AND[/b] the definition for the [i]'Submarine'[/i] keyword.

[hr]
[b]Use of special characters in keywords/synonyms[/b]
Most special characters (ie, except for <, >, =, /, \, ", and leading apostrophes) and trailing apostrophes are supported in keywords/synonyms.

'Smart' quotes are not supported in keywords/synonyms and the use of other typographic characters (see [url=https://www.w3.org/wiki/Common_HTML_entities_used_for_typography]Common HTML entities used for typography[/url] in keywords/synonyms may cause issues and/or make them difficult to use.

[hr]
[b]Other limitations/known issues[/b]
The use of the [i]http://[/i] or [i]https://[/i] strings is not supported in keywords, synonyms or definitions.

[hr]
[b]Fonts[/b]
The fonts used for displaying Glossary keywords and/or definitions are defined as follows:
 
Font family for displaying definitions shown in tooltips:
.ui-widget in ./Themes/default/css/glossary/glossary.ui.tooltip.css

Font family for displaying keywords/definitions in the Glossary list:
.glossary_keyword_def in ./Themes/default/css/glossary/glossary.css

To change between a [i]serif[/i] font and a [i]sans-serif[/i] font change the order of the [i]font-family[/i] lines and clear the forum cache (you may also need to disable the [i]Administration Center > Features and Options > General > Minimize CSS and JavaScript files[/i] option if this is enabled).
